Group 14 --> "The KOMpilers" :
Kyle Visintainer kjv23@pitt.edu,
Olivia Terry ort13@pitt.edu, &
Marko Melishchuk mam900@pitt.edu

Description: 
- Our group decided to determine "the Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh" by evaluating the most important factors which make a neighborhood the best place to comfortably raise a family. The metrics that we decided were critical to this evaluation were the median age of death (lower median age = higher chance of loss of parents), the number of students in each neighborhood that are enrolled in Pittsburgh's public schools, and the levels of toxic chemicals in the air (since cities are already typically areas of such highly polluted air).

Datasets used:
- Allegheny County Median Age at Death (Kyle)

- Pittsburgh Public Schools Enrollment by Neighborhood 2020-21 School Year (Olivia)

- Toxic Air Releases (Marko)

Abstract:
- The best neighborhood(s): Carrick and Squirrel Hill South!

- How we arrived at this conclusion: Our group strategized a system for comparison by assigning point values respective to the winners of each of the three metrics (median age of death, public school enrollment, and toxic air releases). Kyle determined that the neighborhood with the latest median age of death was Squirrel Hill South, Olivia found that Carrick had the highest total public school enrollment and that Beechview had the most diverse public school environment, and Marko found that toxic air release wasn't necessarily as critical a factor as initially anticipated; every neighborhood other than Clairton, Springdale, Sheraden, and Neville Island had a mostly harmless level of chemicals in the air. Based on these analyses, our combined metrics served to conclude that Carrick and Squirrel Hill South emerged tied as the best neighborhoods to raise a family comfortably with the highest number of points (3 each).
