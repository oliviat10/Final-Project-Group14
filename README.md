Description: 
- Our group decided to determine "the Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh" by evaluating the most important factors which make a neighborhood the best place to comfortably raise a family. The metrics that we decided were critical to this evaluation were the levels of toxic chemicals in the air (since cities are already typically areas of highly polluted air), the number of students in each neighborhood that are enrolled in Pittsburgh's public schools, and frequency of crime. 

Datasets used:
- Toxic Chemical Exposure (Marko)
- Educational Enrollment (Olivia)
- Police Blotter (Kyle)

Abstract:
- The best neighborhood: ____

- How we arrived at this conclusion: ____
